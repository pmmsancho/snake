Reinforcement Learning Project

This is the code from the blogpost found here: 

The structure is as follows:
0. Code   --- Shows the pygame code as well as runs the already trained algorithm. A second player is already inserted in the game
1. Output --- The Q Tables are saved here as well as the png of the Model Performance
2. Images --- Since this game is using pngs for the Snake and the Snacks, these are saved here
3. Sounds --- For a hyper realistic game, Snake Snack eating sounds are saved in this folder
