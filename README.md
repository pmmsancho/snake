The structure is as follows:
0. Code   --- Shows the pygame code as well as runs the already trained algorithm. A second player is already inserted in the game
1. Output --- The Q Tables are saved here as well as the png of the Model Performance
2. Images --- Since this game is using pngs for the Snake and the Snacks, these are saved here
3. Sounds --- For a hyper realistic game, Snake Snack eating sounds are saved in this folder 

Running the code leads to the starting page of the game, which looks like this:


The game itself looks like this:



## Rules of the game
- Eat more rabbits than the reinforcement snake and die less often - What counts is the eating/dying ratio
- You have to eat the green rabbits, your opponent has to eat the red ones
- Your snake dies when it runs against a wall/ itself or the other snake, you are then getting respawned directly
